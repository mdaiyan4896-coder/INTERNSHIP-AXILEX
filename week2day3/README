Week 2–Day 3: Strings & Operations

Tasks Completed
Reversed a given string
Checked whether a string is palindrome
Counted vowels and consonants in a string
Found character frequency in a string
Performed basic string slicing operations

Expected Outcome
To understand how string operations work in Python and practice different ways of handling strings.

Actual Outcome
All string operations worked properly. I was able to reverse strings, check palindromes, count vowels and consonants, find character frequency, and use slicing without any issues.

Files Included
reverse_string.py  
palindrome_string.py  
vowel_consonant_count.py  
char_frequency.py  
string_slicing.py  

Note
All programs were executed in VS Code and screenshots of outputs were uploaded.
