Tasks
Program to check even or odd number  
Program to find the largest of three numbers  
Program to check pass or fail based on marks  
Expected Outcomes
Apply conditional statements to solve basic logical problems.  
Correctly evaluate conditions using if-elif-else.  
Actual Outcomes

Verified outputs using multiple test inputs.
Task-wis
Task 1: Even or Odd  
Expected Outcome:  
To take a number as input and correctly identify whether it is even or odd using conditional statements.  
Actual Outcome:  
The program successfully checks the entered number and displays whether it is even or odd for different test inputs.
Task 2: Largest of Three Numbers  
Expected Outcome:  
To compare three input numbers and determine the largest number using if-elif-else conditions.  
Actual Outcome:  
The program correctly compares the three numbers and prints the largest value for multiple input cases.
Task 3: Pass/Fail  
Expected Outcome:  
To accept marks as input and display pass or fail based on the given condition using conditional statements.  
Actual Outcome:  
The program accurately evaluates the marks and displays pass or fail results according to the defined criteria.
